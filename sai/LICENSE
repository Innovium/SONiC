This Software License Agreement (the "Agreement") is a legal agreement between you, Licensee, and Innovium, Inc., a Delaware corporation with its principal office at 6001 America Center Drive, Suite 200, San Jose, California, 95002 ("Innovium"). As used in this Agreement, "you," “your” and "Licensee" mean the company, entity or individual that is acquiring a license under this Agreement.

By downloading or using the software listed on Appendix A, and any updates thereto made available by Innovium pursuant to Section 4, (“Software”) and associated documentation (“Documentation”), you are consenting to be bound by and are becoming a party to this Agreement.  Software expressly excludes the open source software listed on Appendix B (“Open Source Software”).  If you are an entity, and an individual is entering into this Agreement on your behalf, then you will be bound by this Agreement when that individual downloads the Software. When they do so, it will also constitute a representation by the individual that he/she is authorized to bind you as a party to this Agreement. If you do not agree to all of the terms of this Agreement, do not download the Software.

1. LICENSE GRANT.  Subject to your compliance with this Agreement, Innovium hereby grants you a limited, revocable, personal, non-exclusive, non-sublicensable, non-transferable, royalty-free license solely to:

(a) to use the Software for your internal evaluation solely for the purpose of developing application programs ("Developer Programs") that will be used in conjunction with, or will interface with, the Software and Innovium proprietary integrated circuits described in the Documentation ("Innovium Chips"); and

(b) reproduce and distribute the Software, solely in object code form, incorporated into or integrated with Developer Programs solely for use with Innovium Chips.

You acknowledge that any Open Source Software provided with the Software is not part of the Software licensed hereunder and is subject to and governed solely by the terms of the applicable license(s) for those components and not by this Agreement.

2. RESTRICTIONS.  The Software is licensed, not sold.  Except as otherwise expressly authorized herein, you may not directly or indirectly: use, disclose, modify, sublicense, sell, assign, distribute or otherwise exploit in any manner the Software or Documentation (or any modifications or derivative works thereof), including that you may not directly or indirectly use the Software or Documentation (or any modifications or derivative works thereof) to create or facilitate the creation of, or otherwise incorporate any portion of the Software or Documentation in, any product or service that is competitive with the Software or Innovium integrated circuits, use the Software to perform comparisons or other “benchmarking” activities, remove any proprietary notices or branding from the Software or Documentation and/or use the Software or Documentation in violation of any applicable laws or regulations or otherwise outside of the scope of the license granted in Section 1.  In addition, you may not directly or indirectly obtain or attempt to obtain the source code for the Software by any means, including reverse engineering, decompilation, disassembly, translation or similar manipulation of the Software. The Software is not designed or licensed for use in hazardous environments, safety critical or life support applications, or where personal injury or bodily harm may result from Software use. This Agreement shall automatically terminate upon your failure to comply with any of the terms of this Agreement. In such event, you will destroy all copies of the Software and its component parts.

3. OWNERSHIP.  The Software and the Documentation are proprietary products of Innovium. Innovium or its licensors will retain ownership of the Software, the Software, Documentation and all patents, copyrights, trade secrets and other proprietary rights relating thereto. Except as provided in Section 1 above, you have no right, title or interest in the Software or the Documentation.  You will own all rights, title and interest in and to the Developer Programs you may develop, except for any libraries, data or code included in the Developer Programs that are also included in the Software. You hereby covenant that you will not assert any claim that the Software or derivative works thereof created by or for Innovium infringe any intellectual property right owned or controlled by you or any of your affiliates.  The Software and Documentation is protected by the copyright laws of the United States and international copyright treaties.  Nothing in this Agreement gives you a right to use any of Innovium’s trade names, trademarks, service marks, logos, domain names, or other distinctive brand features.  Innovium does not grant any and reserves all rights not expressly and unambiguously granted herein.

4. SUPPORT.  Nothing in this Agreement shall obligate Innovium to provide any support for the Software. Innovium may, but shall be under no obligation to, correct any defects in the Software and/or provide updates to Licensees of the Software. In the event that Innovium elects to provide upgrades to the Software in connection with any such support, such upgrades shall be included within the definition of Software and shall be provided subject to the rights and restrictions set forth in this Agreement. You shall, at it your own expense, be solely responsible for providing technical support and training to your customers for Developer Programs and/or Software, and Innovium shall have no obligation with respect thereto. You shall be solely responsible for, and Innovium shall have no obligation to honor, any warranties that you provide to your customers or to end users with respect to the Software, derivative works, or Developer Programs.  You shall defend any claim against Innovium arising in connection with any such warranties, express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, and shall pay any settlements or damages awarded against Innovium that are based on any such warranties.  You acknowledge that Innovium may modify or discontinue offering the Software at any time without notice.

5. INDEMNITY.  You hereby agree to indemnify, defend and hold harmless Innovium and its affiliates, and each of their directors, officers, employees and agents, ("Indemnified Parties") for any and all losses, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including attorneys’ fees) resulting from any third party claim, suit or proceeding arising from or based upon use or distribution of the Developer Programs or upon your breach of your obligations under this Agreement; provided the Indemnified Parties give you written notice of any such claim, suit or proceeding within a reasonable time.

6. WARRANTY DISCLAIMER.  INNOVIUM PROVIDES THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY OF ANY KIND AND HEREBY DISCLAIMS, FOR ITSELF AND ITS LICENSORS AND SUPPLIERS, ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES, INCLUDING WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, PERFORMANCE, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, NON-INFRINGEMENT, AND WARRANTIES ARISING OUT OF COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, COURSE OF DEALING OR USAGE IN TRADE.

NOTWITHSTANDING ANYTHING ELSE, UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES SHALL INNOVIUM OR ITS LICENSORS OR SUPPLIERS BE LIABLE TO YOU OR ANY OTHER PERSON WITH RESPECT TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY CONTRACT, TORT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, WARRANTY OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY, FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, LOSS OF DATA, COSTS OF PROCUREMENT OF SUBSTITUTE GOODS, SERVICES, TECHNOLOGY OR RIGHTS, INTERRUPTION OF BUSINESS, ACCURACY OF RESULTS, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, EVEN IF ADVISED OR AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

8. BASIS OF BARGAIN.  YOU AND INNOVIUM EACH RECOGNIZE AND AGREE THAT THE WARRANTY DISCLAIMERS AND LIABILITY AND REMEDY LIMITATIONS IN THIS AGREEMENT ARE MATERIAL, BARGAINED FOR BASES FOR THIS AGREEMENT AND THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT AND REFLECTED IN DETERMINING THE CONSIDERATION TO BE GIVEN BY EACH PARTY UNDER THIS AGREEMENT AND IN THE DECISION BY EACH PARTY TO ENTER INTO THIS AGREEMENT.  THESE LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING ANY FAILURE OF ESSENTIAL PURPOSE OF ANY LIMITED REMEDYTO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.

9. CONFIDENTIALITY.  You acknowledge and agree that the Software and Documentation constitute the confidential and proprietary information of Innovium, and that your protection thereof is an essential condition to your use and possession of the Software.  You shall retain the Software and Documentation in strict confidence and not disclose them to any third party or use them in any way except as permitted by this Agreement without Innovium’s express written consent.  You will protect the confidentiality of the Software and Documentation using those measures that you use to protect your most sensitive software and information, but in no event less than reasonable measures. You will immediately notify Innovium of any unauthorized use, access to or disclosure of the Software or Documentation of which you become aware.  Any breach of this Section 9 would cause irreparable injury to Innovium for which no adequate remedy at law exists.  Therefore, you agree that equitable remedies, including injunctive relief and specific performance, are appropriate remedies to redress any breach or threatened breach of this Section 9, in addition to all other remedies available to Innovium. You will not directly or indirectly disclose or provide a copy of Software or Documentation to any other infrastructure and/or networking silicon solution provider.

No other rights are granted.

13. MISCELLANEOUS.  This Agreement contains the complete agreement between you and Innovium regarding the Software and Documentation and supersedes all prior agreements and representations between you and Innovium regarding the Software and Documentation.  This Agreement may only be amended, and any provision may only be waived by a writing executed by both parties.  You agree to promptly provide Innovium with all information and documentation that Innovium requests to verify your compliance with this Agreement.  If any provision of this Agreement is held to be invalid or unenforceable, it shall be reformed to the limited extent necessary to make it enforceable.  The failure of either party to exercise any of its rights will not constitute a waiver of such rights unless expressly agreed inwriting.

Licensee is not an agent of Innovium for any purpose and has no power or authority, whether apparent, actual, ostensible, or otherwise to bind or commit Innovium to any obligations in any way.
